# stripe-interview
This is what my stripe interview was like

for some reason, stripe is super anal about their interviews and wanted me to remove it from my repo. When I interviewed with them, it was not made clear that the code I wrote for the problem I was solving was meant to be private. I want my code to be public and if it breaches any laws directly, create an issue on the repo and I'll try to address them directly
